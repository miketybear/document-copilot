# Document Copilot

An internal AI chatbot that lets employees query a corpus of company policies, guidelines, and technical work instructions in plain English and get sourced, citable answers.

## Why

Employees waste real time hunting through scattered policy and procedure documents to answer routine questions. Document Copilot eats that search work: ask a question in plain English, get an answer grounded in and cited to the source document, so you can trust it enough to act on it.

## Prerequisites

Install these before setting up `backend/` or `frontend/`:

| Tool | Version | Used for | Install |
| ---- | ------- | -------- | ------- |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) | 3.12+ | Backend runtime | OS package manager or python.org |
| [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) | latest | Backend deps + `data/download.py` | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | 20+ (LTS) | Frontend toolchain | nodejs.org or `nvm install --lts` |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) | latest | Frontend package manager | `corepack enable && corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate` |

You also need accounts/keys for external services once the app is wired up. Start with [docs/guides/supabase-setup.md](docs/guides/supabase-setup.md) (account + project), then provision an [Azure OpenAI resource](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/create-resource) with a chat and an embedding model deployment when the LLM layer is wired up.

## Running locally

To be added during the build. Setup guides:

- [Supabase](docs/guides/supabase-setup.md) — account, hosted project (dashboard or CLI)
- [Backend](docs/guides/backend-setup.md)
- [Frontend](docs/guides/frontend-setup.md)

## Sample data

`data/download.py` is the original template's starter downloader — it fetches a small local 10-K sample from SEC EDGAR so the app has something to index out of the box.
Edit the params at the top of `data/download.py`, especially `USER_AGENT`, then run:

```bash
uv run data/download.py
```

By default this downloads the latest 5 10-K filings for AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMZN, and GOOGL into year folders under `data/downloads/` and writes a `manifest.json`.
Downloaded files are gitignored; the `data/` folder itself stays in git for the script and notes.

For real use, swap this out for your own document set (company policies, guidelines, work instructions) — see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for how ingestion is expected to work.
